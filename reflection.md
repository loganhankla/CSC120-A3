- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Maggie Needham
    Bethany Stephens
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    I attended TA office hours on the nights of 2/14 and 2/15.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    It's a little confusing. I'm still stuck on how everything has to be an object. Class definitions are confusing to me and know when you need to declare things at the beginning of a line (like static, public, void, int, etc.). Parts of it are very similar to Python, so that was nice, but small syntax differences were a little confusing at points.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    I think a lot of the basic ideas and methods of programming are similar between languages, you just have to use different syntax. But the syntax is easy to find online (like else if/elif, for loop construction, i++, etc.).
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Definitely going one step at a time, running and re-running a lot in between changes. I figured things out a lot by running and just analyzing how what was produced was different with different code. Don't change a ton at a time. Also, definitely ask for help. It's confusing. Make use of office hours and TA hours if you can make it! 

    Being flexible and willing to change your methods is also important. Even if you spent a lot of time moving in one direction, completely changing how you go about fulfilling a step/requirement can sometimes be so much more efficient and worth your time/energy. 

    Also start coding soon. Don't wait til the last two days before it's due. I've been doing that and letting it get on the backburner while I do assignments due earlier, and it works, but it'd be less stressful if I started earlier. Even just starting on the very first step, get some code in your file early in the week. Get your brain thinking about it.
